Maintaining the appropriate bundle provides optimal performance and compatibility with ongoing hardware and software updates. HP works with you to review your currently installed firmware levels. We then determine the appropriate bundle based on your configuration and on the version of HP CloudSystem Matrix software you are running. We plan the installation process with the goal of minimizing inconvenience to your business, by considering options for transferring workloads between servers or working within maintenance windows. HP verifies the deployment has been successful, provides documentation of the changes and completes the service with a customer signoff. This service covers a single CloudSystem Matrix enclosure with all its components, upgraded during a single visit. The service excludes installation or upgrade of the CloudSystem Matrix software stack. Two versions are available: One version applies to the first enclosure in your environment. Another version applies to one additional enclosure assessed during the same engagement at the same location.",

This service helps the Customer understand these capabilities and apply them through hands-on experience. The Account Support Manager (ASM) conducts a workshop to investigate how ICpm can be used to help the Customer gain advantage in their  IT environment.  The output of the workshop is an outline for several use cases that the ASM then fully develops and demonstrates in the Customer’s environment: Monitoring – Implement comprehensive power and temperature monitoring;  identify potential overloads, redundancy errors and hot-spots within Customer’s IT environment which could lead to unnecessary downtime. Control – Classify servers and develop pre-defined rules to protect critical workloads during power or cooling events by shedding system power load, restricting their power consumption or altering power regulator states. Capping – Review benefits of dynamic power capping for reclaiming trapped power capacity.  If necessary, implement single server or enclosure-level capping based on conservative criteria; develop more aggressive capping values based on monitored actual and historical power usage (extended data collection required). The ASM schedules a return visit to discuss open issues, to review any execution of power control rules and to reassess the dynamic power capping configuration. This service provides detailed usage for a complete blade enclosure or rack, and general usage for up to 2 enclosures or racks, within the supported environment. The customer must have the current version of ICpm installed and operational.  For complete requirements, refer to the HP Insight Software Support Matrix on hp.com.",

The ASM describes the standard and custom reports and the range of analysis that this service can provide. Reports include detailed listings and relationships between assets, host names, device models and types, OS versions, and applications and their versions. The ASM uses the HP Asset Inventory Discovery Application to discover hardware devices based on IP addresses and software instances based on system installation logs. If necessary, HP will supplement this data with other manual or automated collection methods to complete the inventory.\nWhen discovery is complete, the ASM prepares the reports and meets with the Customer to further analyze the information. The inventory and report data is available in Excel format for the Customer’s continued reference. The report also lists the status of any HP support agreements associated with the inventoried hardware products. This can help the Customer for determining if critical infrastructure is supported at appropriate levels. This service is designed to discover up to approximately 1,000 devices located within the covered service environment. The ASM can price for larger environments with more than 1,000 devices.",

The service covers a Customer-identified segment of the supported environment, consisting up to one storage array, two SAN switches, 10 rack-mounted servers and two blade enclosures. The Customer must allow HP to install data collection tools as specified by HP.
